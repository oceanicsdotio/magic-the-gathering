# Gathering

## Purpose

This is a reference implementation for a cross platform application using Expo, React Native, [MMKV](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv), and Storybook. 

## Quickstart

The Expo project was initialized with `npx expo init .`. Storybook was added with the step [described in the React Native tutorial](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/intro-to-storybook/react-native/en/get-started/). It was necessary to modify the `addons.js` file to get things working.

The app can be started on the Expo server with `expo start`, which will publish an iOS and Web version on MacOS.

To run just the mobile version you can `yarn ios`.
